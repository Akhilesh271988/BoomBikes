# Boom Bike Service # 
Bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

## Approach

To get at the ultimate result, a linear regression model was created to identify the drivers of bike sharing systems.
- Unnecessary variables were removed from the data;
- EDA was used to determine the relationship between variables.
- Training data was prepared to build the model 
- Assumptions were evaluated to ensure the model's authenticity - The model was tested on a testing dataset.

The R2 of model and testing data set is __81%__ and __77%__ respectively, as we have good R2 on tarining and testing dataset , this model can be consider as good model to predict the usage of cycle
